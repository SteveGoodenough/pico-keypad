# pico-keypad

Need to build out this but added here to pass to someone on Bluesky who's creating the same keypad and asked for a copy of the code

It requires the Adafruit image to enable the pico to act as a keyboard device when plugged into the pc

I adapted this from a gist I found but made this sso you can customize what each key does, and they can be keyboard or consumer codes (like media controls)

I'll add more details later about the keypad itself etc
