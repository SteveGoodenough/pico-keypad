# pico-keypad

Need to build out this but added here to pass to someone on Bluesky who's creating the same keypad and asked for a copy of the code

It requires the Adafruit image to enable the pico to act as a keyboard device when plugged into the pc

I adapted this from a gist I found but made this so I could customize what each key does, and each key can be a keyboard shortcut or consumer code (like media controls)

I'll add more details later about the keypad itself etc
